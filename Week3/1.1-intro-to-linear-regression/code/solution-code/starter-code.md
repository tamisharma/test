Solution code, when needed, should live in this folder. 

Solution code format should match the starter code format as closely as possible. You can use markdown, python, iPython notebooks, or other scripts as needed.

If your starter code included multiple sections - e.g. a guided practice and an independent practice, make sure to also divide your solution code by headings for each.

If including multiple files, include a readme to list contents. 


The relative link to a solution-code file from the lesson/lab would be:
`[name](./code/solution-code/file.md)`
